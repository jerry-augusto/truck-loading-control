**Truck Loading Control** is an Excel tool to control and automate truck loading

It is basically a spreadsheet with VBA that allow the user to input information about truck loads, generating a clean database for futuredata analysis.

I created it from scratch for an industry that had several by-products to be loaded and all the load registration was done manually on paper.

The tool allows you to monitor 8 different products with up to 4 different specifications and has self-correcting tools to inhibit data entry errors.
